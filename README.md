# Fluxlet Example - TodoMVC

This is an implementation of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) using the Fluxlet
framework.

## Setup

    $ npm install

Will install all npm dependencies, including jspm,
and then perform a jspm install.

## Run it

    $ npm run serve

It should open in a browser tab at http://localhost:3000

## Test it

After starting the server as above...

    $ cd tests
    $ npm install
    $ npm run test

Some of the tests are currently failing, I'm not sure why as the features
appear to work fine when tested manually.
